The code is to play spin the wheel game with computer vision. It records a selected area color change and predicts the next time the same area will change color.

1. Follow the UI to select the detection area.
2. After quitting the program, the saved detection area will be saved in json file.
3. The game will automatically run until it runs out of saved detection area, then you need to manually select the area.
4. The logic is smart enough to detect quick and slow patterns, including consistent patterns like A-A-A-A or inconsistent patterns like A-B-A-B.
5. Watch the console output to check the log of the precision of detection.
